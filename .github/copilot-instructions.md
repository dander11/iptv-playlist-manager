**Crafting the best practices**

I’m narrowing down the Copilot Meta-Level Best Practices doc, focusing on Git, coding, testing, code review, and more. CI/CD is out, but tests are in.
# Copilot Meta-Level Best Practices

A universal blueprint for writing maintainable, reliable, and collaborative code. This focuses on version control, coding principles, documentation, testing, review, observability, and team processes—without touching on CI/CD pipelines.  

---

## Introduction

These instructions guide Copilot (and any developer) to produce high-quality code that’s easy to understand, test, and maintain over time.  

---

## Git and Version Control

- Feature-branch workflow  
  1. Prefix branches by type: `feature/`, `bugfix/`, `hotfix/`.  
  2. Rebase onto `main` frequently to minimize conflicts.  

- Granular commits  
  - One logical change per commit.  
  - Use a structured commit message:
    ```
    <type>(<scope>): <short summary>

    - Detailed explanation of what changed and why
    ```  

- Clear `.gitignore`  
  - Exclude build artifacts, credentials, and local configs.  
  - Audit periodically to prevent accidental check-ins.  

- Semantic tags  
  - Follow Semantic Versioning: `vMAJOR.MINOR.PATCH`.  

- Signed commits  
  - Encourage GPG/SSH signing for traceability.

## Coding Principles

- Style guides  
  - Python: PEP 8  
  - JavaScript/TS: Airbnb or Google  
  - Go: `gofmt` conventions  

- SOLID design  
  - Single Responsibility, Open/Closed, Liskov, Interface Segregation, Dependency Inversion.  

- Simplicity  
  - KISS, DRY, YAGNI.  
  - Prioritize readability over clever one-liners.  

- Explicit errors  
  - Throw or return precise exceptions.  
  - Avoid silent catches; always log or propagate.  

- Dependency injection  
  - Facilitate mocking and lower coupling.  

---

## Documentation and Comments

- Top-level README  
  - Project overview, setup, architecture, contribution guide.  

- Docstrings for public APIs  
  - Use consistent format (Javadoc, Google, NumPy).  

- Versioned `docs/`  
  - Architecture diagrams, ADRs, decision logs.  
  - Automate doc builds to catch stale content.  

---

## Testing and Quality Assurance

- Coverage threshold  
  - Aim for at least 80% on critical modules.  

- Testing pyramid  
  1. Unit tests for core logic.  
  2. Integration tests for component interaction.  
  3. End-to-end tests only for critical flows.  

- Test-Driven Development (TDD)  
  - Write failing tests first to clarify requirements.  

- Fast, deterministic tests  
  - Use mocks, fakes, and fixtures where appropriate.  

- Automated linting & static analysis  
  - Tools like ESLint, Flake8, SonarQube in pre-commit or IDE.  

---

## Code Review and Collaboration

- PR templates & checklists  
  - Description, testing steps, impact analysis, docs updates.  

- Small PRs  
  - Keep under ~300 lines changed for faster review.  

- Constructive feedback  
  - Focus on code quality; ask questions rather than decree.  

- Thread hygiene  
  - Resolve or reassign review comments promptly.  

---

## Project Organization and Modularization

- Consistent layout  
  ```
  ├── cmd/         # entry points
  ├── pkg/         # reusable libraries
  ├── internal/    # private modules
  ├── docs/        # documentation
  ├── scripts/     # automation scripts
  └── tests/       # integration and e2e tests
  ```

- Clear module boundaries  
  - Each package addresses a specific domain or service.  

- Centralized configuration  
  - Pull from env vars, config files, or secret manager.  

---

## Logging and Observability

- Structured logs  
  - Standard levels: DEBUG, INFO, WARN, ERROR.  
  - Include context: timestamps, request/trace IDs.  

- Central aggregation  
  - ELK, Splunk, Loki, or equivalent.  

- Tracing  
  - Use correlation IDs to connect distributed calls.  

- Log hygiene  
  - Rotate, archive, and monitor volume regularly.  

---

## Performance and Optimization

- Benchmark first  
  - Measure critical paths before tuning.  

- Profiling  
  - Tools: `perf`, Go pprof, JProfiler, etc.  

- Caching  
  - In-memory, CDN, or DB level with proper invalidation.  

- Data loading  
  - Lazy load or paginate large datasets.  

- Monitoring  
  - Dashboards tracking latency and throughput.  

---

## Onboarding and Knowledge Transfer

- Developer guide in `docs/`  
  - Setup steps, coding standards, common tasks.  

- Sample or “hello world” templates  
  - Quick ways to test local environments.  

- Brown-bag talks & pair programming  
  - Share new patterns and lessons learned.  

- Architectural Decision Records  
  - Document the rationale behind major changes.  

---

## Backup and Disaster Recovery

- Define objectives  
  - RTO (Recovery Time Objective) and RPO (Recovery Point Objective).  

- Automated backups  
  - Databases, file stores; store off-site copies.  

- Restoration drills  
  - Quarterly tests to verify procedure and data integrity.  

- Versioned runbooks  
  - Step-by-step recovery guides in repo.  

---

## Culture and Continuous Improvement

- “You built it, you run it”  
  - Promote service ownership.  

- Celebrate wins  
  - Faster builds, reduced debt, impactful refactors.  

- Regular retrospectives  
  - Focus on process, tooling, and debt backlog.  

- Living Tech Radar  
  - Track approved tools, patterns, and emerging tech.

With testing firmly in place and CI/CD instructions removed, this meta-guide keeps your codebase robust, transparent, and ready for any collaborative workflow.
